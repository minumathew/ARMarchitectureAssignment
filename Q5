/*On you Hardware board STMF32  find out how you can input a number either through key board or through some kind of sensor
and decide whether that is even or ODD */
input number can be obtained using an infinte while loop, waiting for a keypress.And using the captured input the logic for q3 can be used to find
if it is odd or even.
Number can also be input in binary using I/O pins and push buttons.
